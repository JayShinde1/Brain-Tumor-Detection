# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This dataset is taken from Kaggle and detects if a person has a brain tumor or not.

Project Description
This project aims to automate the detection of brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. Early diagnosis of brain tumors is crucial for timely treatment and improved survival rates. This system leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify brain scans into tumor or no tumor categories.

Key Features:
✅ Image Preprocessing: MRI scans are processed to enhance image quality, resize them, and normalize pixel values.
✅ Model Training: A deep learning model, likely based on CNN architecture, is trained on a labeled dataset of brain images.
✅ Classification: Given an input MRI scan, the system predicts whether a brain tumor is present or not.
✅ Visualization: The project includes visualizations such as sample images, accuracy graphs, and loss curves to better understand the model’s performance.

Technologies Used:
Python
TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning)
OpenCV / PIL (for image handling)
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (for data manipulation and visualization)
Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation and analysis)
